# changelog-section.sh — print one version's section body from CHANGELOG.md.
#
# Usage:
#   .github/scripts/changelog-section.sh 0.4.0    # body of "## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-03"
#   .github/scripts/changelog-section.sh v0.4.0   # a leading "v" is dropped
#
# Prints everything between that heading and the next "## " heading, without the blank
# lines around it. release.yml puts the result under "What's Changed".
#
# Exit code: non-zero when the heading is missing or its section is empty — a release
# note that silently loses its changes is worse than a failed release.
